# Local OCR repair

- [x] Trace the local OCR engine, language configuration, image preprocessing, and result post-processing.
- [x] Reproduce the supplied Russian comic-panel failures: merged words, Latin/Cyrillic substitutions, UI-text capture, and false gibberish.
- [ ] Add a safe Russian-oriented comic-text preprocessing and recognition path without weakening other configured languages.
- [ ] Add regression coverage for representative Russian text-panel crops and reject low-confidence garbage.
- [ ] Build, test, and manually validate OCR results on the supplied screenshots.
- [ ] Configure and trigger the Android APK build only through the repository's GitHub Actions runner; do not assemble APK locally.
- [ ] Commit and push the verified local OCR fix directly to `sj0404-collab/yomihon-custom` on `main`.
